                <p>
                    Hailing from the picturesque town of Gisborne, New Zealand, Zoe Proudfoot discovered a lifelong passion for writing that began in school, 
                    where English emerged as one of her standout subjects. However, it wasn't until 2022, 
                    after rediscovering the joy of reading, that Zoe felt compelled to delve into the world of writing once again.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With a penchant for the enticing allure of romance, Zoe crafts stories that 
                    captivate readers with a perfect blend of emotion and intrigue. 
                    Inspired by the works of influential authors like Sadie Kincaid, 
                    particularly her LA Ruthless and New York Ruthless series, 
                    Zoe weaves narratives that offer a tantalizing mix of passion and suspense.
                </p>
                <p>
                    When immersed in the creative process, you'll find Zoe accompanied by a steamy cup of tea 
                    and the occasional feline writing companion. Writing throughout the day, 
                    Zoe embraces the flexibility to adapt her routine based on the ever-changing whims of inspiration.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The journey from the initial spark of an idea to witnessing a nearly finished book has already marked a significant achievement. 
                    With a deep desire for readers to find as much joy in reading her stories as Zoe finds in writing them, 
                    the anticipation for a captivating literary journey is just beginning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Stay tuned for Zoe Proudfoot's upcoming releases, and embark on a passionate voyage into the realms of love and storytelling.

            <h2>10 Fun Facts About Me</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>I talk in my sleep</li>
                <p>And it's probably a plot twist, a murder mystery reveal, or me asking for a cup of tea that I probably won't finish.</p>
            
                <li>My first story idea came to me while working in the kiwifruit orchards</li>
                <p>Because apparently, if I'm left alone for long enough without distractions, my brain just invents entire worlds. Trees, fruit, and mafia romance—what more could you want?</p>
            
                <li>If I could have dinner with any fictional character, it would be Dutch from Red Dead Redemption 2.</li>
                <p>Not a book character, I know, but could you imagine the philosophical debates? I'd sit there nodding, pretending I understand his plans for world domination while secretly analyzing the pros and cons for my next book.</p>
            
                <li>I can read <em>Fierce King</em> by Sadie Kincaid over and over again.</li>
                <p>This book dragged me out of my reading slump like a hero rescuing a damsel in distress. I've re-read it so many times, my paperback looks like it's been through an actual mafia battle.</p>
            
                <li>I don't have any quirky writing habits.</li>
                <p>I wish I could tell you I light a candle and chant inspirational mantras, but it's more like, “Can I squeeze in writing today between classes, life, and tea breaks?” Not very glamorous, but it works.</p>
            
                <li>My favourite quote is from <em>Daisy Jones and the Six</em> by Taylor Jenkins Reid:</li>
                <p><em>“I am not a muse. I am the somebody. End of fucking story.”</em> If this quote doesn't make you want to stand up and fist-bump, are you even living your best life?</p>
            
                <li>If I weren't writing, I'd pursue a career in technology.</li>
                <p>Considering I'm studying a Bachelor in Computing, this one's easy. If mafia romance doesn't work out, I'll be your go-to tech support person. Probably while still drinking tea.</p>
            
                <li>I don't believe in guilty pleasures.</li>
                <p>Guilty pleasure? What's that? I watch <em>Shortland Street</em> almost every night and feel zero shame about it. In fact, I wear it like a badge of honour.</p>
            
                <li>If I could live in any fictional world, it would be <em>Heartland</em>.</li>
                <p>Horses, ranch life, and none of the mafia drama. Sign me up. I'm ready to live my peaceful, horse-whispering life.</p>
            
                <li>My go-to snack while writing?</li>
                <p>Anything quick, easy, and probably unhealthy. There's also always a cup of tea nearby, though, whether it's hot or cold? That's up for debate.</p>
